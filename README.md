# V Car Removal

Marketing site for V Car Removal, a cash-for-cars and free car removal
business serving Brisbane, Ipswich, Caboolture, Gold Coast, Logan, Moreton
Bay, Redlands, Sunshine Coast and Toowoomba (QLD).

Built with Next.js (App Router), TypeScript and Tailwind CSS v4.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in the values you have — the site
runs without any of them, but the quote form, analytics and pixel tracking
stay inactive until configured:

- `RESEND_API_KEY` / `CONTACT_TO_EMAIL` / `CONTACT_FROM_EMAIL` — required for
  the contact form (`src/app/api/quote/route.ts`) to actually email quote
  requests. Sign up at [resend.com](https://resend.com) and verify a sending
  domain.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID` — Google Analytics 4 measurement ID.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_META_PIXEL_ID` — Meta (Facebook) Pixel ID.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_GSC_VERIFICATION` — the meta-tag content string from Google
  Search Console (Settings → Ownership verification → HTML tag). Required to
  verify the site in Search Console and submit the sitemap — without this,
  Google won't reliably discover or index the location/service pages.

## Where content lives

Business content is data-driven rather than hardcoded into pages:

- `src/lib/site.ts` — business name, phone, hours, depot, review link
- `src/lib/services.ts` — the six services (`/services/[slug]`)
- `src/lib/locations.ts` — every suburb page (`/locations/[slug]`)
- `src/lib/faqs.ts` — FAQ content (also powers the FAQPage JSON-LD)

Editing those files updates the relevant pages, sitemap and structured data
automatically — no need to touch the page components for routine content
changes.

## Structured data & SEO

- `src/lib/schema.ts` builds JSON-LD (Organization, Service, FAQPage) rendered
  via `src/components/JsonLd.tsx`.
- `src/app/sitemap.ts` and `src/app/robots.ts` are generated from the same
  location/service data.
- `src/app/opengraph-image.tsx` generates the social share image at build time.

## Before going live

- Fill in the real ABN in `src/lib/site.ts` (`abn` field) — the privacy policy
  and terms pages reference it.
- Set `googleReviewCount` in `src/lib/site.ts` once you have a real figure
  from the Google Business Profile.
- Have the privacy policy and terms of use pages reviewed by a solicitor —
  they're a reasonable starting template, not legal advice.
- Configure the env vars above for the quote form to actually deliver leads.

## Scripts

```bash
npm run dev      # start the dev server
npm run build    # production build
npm run start    # run the production build
npm run lint     # eslint
```

## Deployment

Deploys cleanly to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new) or any Node hosting that
supports Next.js. Set the environment variables above in your hosting
provider's dashboard.
